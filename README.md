# Naive-Bayes-and-KNN-Classifiers
This is an implementation of Na誰ve Bayes Classifier and KNN Classifier from scratch using python.
The algorithms are applied on the iris dataset.
More details about the dataset and the dependencies could be found below. 

### iris dataset
iris dataset is one of the most commonly used datasets in the machine learning field. It has four features and three classes (iris setosa, iris versicolor, and iris virginica). 
In this problem, we'll assume that the data were drawn from a Gaussian distribution and implement a Gaussian na誰ve Bayes classifier. Then, we'll implement the KNN classifier.

### Installing
To run the code, you have two options.
1- Run the code using Python IDLE. This requires:
* Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
* Open Python IDLE
* File --> Open --> Na誰ve Bayes and KNN Classifiers.py 
* Run --> Run Module

2- Run the code using Juputer notebook
* install [Juputer notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
* Open command-prompt for Windows users, terminal for MAC or Linux-users
* cd into the project directory and run "Jupyter notebook"
```sh
$ cd Naive-Bayes-and-KNN-Classifiers
$ Jupyter notebook
```
* choose "Na誰ve Bayes and KNN Classifiers.ipnyb" file and run each cell by pressing Shift+Enter. 

### Dependencies
Install the following Python libraries before starting the kernal.
* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* seaborn

You can install it by downloading [get-pip](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/)
Then, run the following command on the command-prompt/terminal 
```sh
$ pip install pandas
```

or you can use conda if you use anaconda
```sh
$ conda install pandas
```
